			<h3>Project 1</h3>
			<p>Namche Bazar is the gateway to Mount Everest. It is the town in Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality in Solukhumbu.It is the town that most trek. It is a real hub and important acclimatisation stop for trekkers and it's grown from a market town, I love eveything about it.I'd heard the name, dreamed of going and saw it for the first time a couple of years ago on our first trek.On most of these treks you will visit Namche twice,It's an up and back route with most people flying in and out of Lukla airport. If you're heading to Everest, Gokyo Lakes, Island Peak or any of the classic routes, this post is about what to expect in Namche  </p>
